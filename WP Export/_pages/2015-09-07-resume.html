<h3>BIO</h3>
<hr />
<h5></h5>
<p class="p1">With a background in physical therapy and sports performance, my biggest strength is found in collaborative environments because I appreciate the different approaches others bring to solving a problem. Whether it’s a disgruntled post-surgical patient or a more efficient way for objects in code to communicate with each other— I am quick in finding ways to contribute and create a positive impact in an organization.</p>
<p class="p1">Like most programmers without a traditional computer science degree, I started programming through self-interest. It was during the rising popularity of wearable technology when I realized computer programming was so versatile that it could relate entirely to what I did as a strength coach at New York University.</p>
<p class="p1">Eventually, I applied to the Flatiron School, where I met some of the most knowledgable instructors who have helped grow as a junior developer. I built a strong foundation of object oriented programming as well as the Cocoa Framework, particularly in Objective-C. Currently, I'd love to contribute my efforts to a growing company in New York City, while continually expanding my strength in programming.</p>
<p class="p1">When not coding, I enjoy playing basketball, lifting with my kettle bells, and shooting with my DSLR camera!</p>
