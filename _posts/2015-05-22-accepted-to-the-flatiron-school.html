excerpt: It’s official- I got accepted into The Flatiron School for iOS Development
  this Summer. The Flatiron School is a 12 week immersive coding camp that provides
  admitted students with the practical skills necessary to work as professional web
  and mobile app developers. I just finished my second year as a strength coach for
  New York University, so the transition from sports performance to computer programming
  cannot be any faster. Nevertheless, I am extremely excited to get going with the
  program come June.

<p>About a year ago, I had absolutely no background in computer programming. Like many other late bloomers learning computer programming, my only resources were books and the helpful people on TreeHouse and Code School- two very popular video-tutorial sites for beginners programmers which, in my opinion, helped me the most back when I started out. As my basic competence of the programming concepts grew, specifically in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SS-9y0H3Si8">object-oriented programming</a>, I soon realized that if I ever planned to write production level code, I would eventually need to let go of Gregg Pollack (listen to his <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/screencasts/founder-s-talk" target="_blank">story</a> on founding Code School) and <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/amit" target="_blank">Amit Bijlani</a>'s virtual hand, so to speak, and learn from more personal instruction. The Flatiron School offers just that.</p>
<p>And while I am 100% certain that anyone can learn a programming language of choice on his or her own, I knew it would have been a long battle for me, considering I was still trying to digest basic HTML and CSS at the start of 2015. If I didn’t get into Flatiron, I would have done just that, trying to learn everything solo. As of this post, I am already one week in the program, and considering everything I’ve learned in just these five days— thank god I'm in.</p>
